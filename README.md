** 2D Array Game

*** Introduction

The 2D Array Game is a simple console-based program that allows users to define a 2D array dynamically by specifying the number of rows and columns. The program then initializes the array and provides basic functionality to interact with it.

*** Features

Accepts user input to determine the size of the 2D array.

Implements input validation to ensure correct data entry.

Dynamically initializes a 2D array based on user input.

Provides a structured and user-friendly console interface.

*** Goals

Demonstrates basic C# console input handling.

Showcases 2D array initialization and management.

Ensures robust input validation to prevent errors.

*** Development Status

Current Version: 1.0.0

Status: Initial implementation

**** Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

The 2D Array Game exists to help beginners understand how to handle user input, validate data, and manipulate two-dimensional arrays in C#. It serves as an introductory project for those looking to enhance their C# programming skills.
